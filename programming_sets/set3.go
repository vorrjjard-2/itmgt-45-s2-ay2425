// Params:
// - fromMember, the subject member
// - toMember, the object member
// - socialGraph, the relationship data
//
// Returns:
// - "follower" if fromMember follows toMember; "followed by" if fromMember is followed by toMember; "friends" if fromMember and toMember follow each other; "no relationship otherwise."
